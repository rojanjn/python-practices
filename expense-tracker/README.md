# Expense Tracker (Python - CLI)

A simple **command-line** expense tracker written in Python.  
It allows users to add, update, delete, and view expenses, set monthly budgets, and receive warnings when budgets are exceeded.

This project is part of my Python practice and focuses on clean structure, modular code, and real-world features.
