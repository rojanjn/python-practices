# Hangman Game (Python + ASCII)

A simple **Hangman game** built with Python for the terminal.  
Right now itâ€™s the classic single-word version with ASCII art.  
Iâ€™m also working on adding a **multi-menu system** (choose categories like Animals, Movies, Programming). This feature is not fully implemented yet but itâ€™s on the roadmap. ðŸš§

---

## Features (Current)
- Random word selection from a word list
- ASCII art gallows that builds up with each wrong guess
- Lives system
- Win or lose messages

---

## Work in Progress
- **Multi-menu system**:  
  Players will be able to choose a category (Animals, Movies, Programming, etc.) before the game starts.
- **Improved ASCII art**:

## Demo (Current)
```text
Welcome to Hangman!
_ _ _ _ _

Wrong guess! Lives left: 5
