# Python Practice â€“ Beginner Edition

This repo is my little Python sandbox.  
Itâ€™s where Iâ€™m practicing all the basics Iâ€™m learning.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

This repository contains a collection of small Python scripts and exercises, built step-by-step as I learn.  
Topics include:
- Variables & Print
- If/Else Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Lists & Dictionaries
- File Handling
- Random experiments & practice tasks

All files are beginner-friendly and written with learning in mind, so itâ€™s okay if things are a little messy or over-commented ðŸ˜„

## Why This Repo Exists

- To keep track of my progress
- To learn by *doing* (and breaking)
